# 06112020-DayPlanner

I started by pseudocoding.

- In HTML, create a placeholder for 'currentTime' 
- In JS file, reference 'container', 'currentDay', and 'currentTime'
- In jumbotron, add currentDay and currentTime text
- Within 'container', add time blocks
- Within time blocks, add input area for todos
- Add save button for input to be saved
- Use local storage to save tasks
- Color code hours by past, present, and future using Moment.JS
- For new day, clear old tasks
